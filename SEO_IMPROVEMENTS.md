## 🔧 Configuration Status

### Domain Configuration
✅ **Domain is set to: dynastylottery.com**

The code already uses `dynastylottery.com` as the default fallback, so everything is configured correctly. 

**Optional:** You can still set an environment variable for consistency:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://dynastylottery.com
```

This is used for:
- Canonical URLs
- Open Graph URLs
- Sitemap URLs
- Structured data URLs

### Google Search Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property (website URL)
3. Verify ownership (you can add verification code to `layout.tsx` metadata.verification.google)
4. Submit your sitemap: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`

### Next Steps for SEO
